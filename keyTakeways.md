# KEY CONCEPTS

## Structuring simple data

* Define values using primitive data types (strings, numbers, booleans, null, and undefined)
* Store them in variables

## Structuring complex data

* Key-value data like the properties of a student? Use an object, and use the keys to refer to the values. For example, if we want to store name and surname of a student, name and surname will be the keys, and we can set string values. Values can be of any data type, even lists/objects.

* Collection of data like a shopping list? Use an array, and use the index/position to refer to the values. Values can be of any data type, even more lists/objects.

## Control the flow of the program

* Use If-Else to choose what code block to execute based on a condition (anything that results in a boolean value)

* Use While to repeat a code block while a condition is true. Exit the loop when the condition becomes false.

* There are also other loops: do-while, for, for-in, list.forEach, etc. But you can already do everything with if-else and while.
